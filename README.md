### 🎮 Who Am I?

I'm a Media Informatics student and game developer with a love for **prototyping fast and iterating hard**. I’ve worked on everything from small 2D experiments to 3D action roguelikes — including a Vampire Survivors-style game, reimagined in 3D.

- 🎮 I build with Unity (C#) and Unreal Engine (Blueprints)
- 🧪 Focused on gameplay feel, responsive controls, and tight loops
- 🧰 Most of my projects are prototypes — I love exploring ideas quickly
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I’ve built games solo and in student teams — always up for collaboration
