### Who Am I?

I'm a Media Informatics student and game developer who enjoys **prototyping quickly and iterating hard**. I've worked on projects ranging from small 2D experiments to 3D action roguelikes â€” including a **Vampire Survivors**-style game, reimagined in 3D.

- **Unity (C#)** and **Unreal Engine (Blueprints)** for game development
- Focused on creating smooth gameplay, responsive controls, and strong game loops
- Passionate about **fast prototyping**, experimenting with new ideas, and refining mechanics
- Experienced in both solo development and team collaborations
